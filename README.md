### Configuring S3 as a Storage Backend

H5P relies on ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` setting to stores h5p content. In case of S3 storage, make sure your platform level S3 storage settings are set appropriately. If you either have set ``AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH = True`` then you have to set custom S3 storage settings for H5P xblock since singed url are not supported or if you want to store H5P content in a separate S3 bucket instead of default one you have to set custom S3 storage settings too.

Here is the required configuration:

```python
H5PXBLOCK_STORAGE = {
    "storage_class": "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage",
    "settings": {
        "bucket_name": "my-s3-public-bucket",
        "querystring_auth": False,
    },
}
```

Please ensure that your bucket is publicly accessible to enable seamless content storage and retrieval via S3.
